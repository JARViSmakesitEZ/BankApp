SIMPLE AND BEAUTIFUL UI FOR A BANK APPLICATION.
IT HAS A LOG IN PAGE.
IT HAS AN INTERFACE WHICH DISPLAYS THE BANK DETAILS OF THE CURRENT LOGGED IN USER.
ONE CAN SEND SOME MONEY FROM THE ACCOUNT TO SOME OTHER USER AND THE INTERFACE WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE IT.


IMPORTANT NOTES TO USE THE APPLICATION:
SINCE ITS A FRONT END PROJECT , I HAVE JUST MADE THIS APPLICATION WITH FOUR USER DATA AS INPUT.
USER 1:Gourav Ghosh , PIN:1111 , USERID:gg
USER 2:Jessica Davis , PIN:2222 , USERID:jd
USER 3:Steven Thomas Williams , PIN:3333 , USERID:stw
USER 4:Sarah Smith , PIN:4444 , USERID:ss

ONE CAN LOGIN THROUGH USERID AND PIN

TO TRANSFER AMOUNT TO OTHER USER , USERID WILL BE USED
